// Prevent double borders by targeting form items that have something on their
// left. In effect, this consistently gives border to the higher layered elements (the ones
// that appear later) by allowing their borders be the dominant one that shows up.
// The later ones already cover the previous ones' bow-shadow and outline glow.
// If the theme uses other colors for borders, an alternate way to do this is by
// setting margin-right to -1px;
//
// This does not get applied to full because full has the whole row. In
// [mobile first] responsive layouts from full to main, the consumer developer
// would simply remove border-right themself. This covers most use cases in which
// responsiveness goes from full to just a main item.
//
// TL;DR this removes border-right sizing on the right side of inputs with
// (supposedly) nothing on their right.
