## Design philosophies/goals
The design decisions of `kelp` has been influenced by these goals of what it wants to enable:
- **Mobile first**: creating a mobile site THEN scaling up to desktop
- **Unopinionated design core**: including simple unopinionated look and feel for the core
- **Themable**: enabling others to easily theme the look and feel
- **Simple and productive workflow**: favoring simplicity for the 90% of use cases over the 10% complex
- **Cross organizational**: enabling easy sharing of widgets to work across multiple organizations

## Conventions
Kelp is more than just a set of sass/js files. It is also set of conventions. Kelp extensions and consumers should follow the kelp conventions. These conventions are designed to enable developers to write css in a unified, clean, and modular way.

These conventions should be keep the css organized while still being easy to understand. Developers new to this framework should be able to write code meaningfully without being bogged down by heavy conventions.
