# Solar css framework

Solar is a front-end css framework developed specifically for cross organizational modularity.

## Design philosophies/goals
The `solar` css framework is:
- **Mobile first**: concepts designed with a mobile first philosophy
- **Unopinionated**: the core is unopinionated in design so developers don't need to
- **Themable**: enabling others to easily theme the look and feel
- **Cross organizational**: helps code (like widgets and modules) be shared across multiple organizations

## Getting started
To see an example of solar in use, see the new client.

To learn about the different parts of the solar ecosystem and how extensions and themes come in, read the [Solar css framework architecture](https://github.com/stellar/solar/blob/master/docs/architecture.md).

To learn about how to write css consistent with the design laid out in solar, read the [solar css guide](https://github.com/stellar/solar/blob/master/docs/css-guide.md).


## Conventions
Solar is more than just a set of sass/js files. It is also set of conventions. Solar extensions and consumers should follow the solar conventions. These conventions are designed to enable developers to write css in a unified, clean, and modular way.

These conventions should be keep the css organized while still being easy to understand. Developers new to this framework should be able to write code meaningfully without being bogged down by heavy conventions.
